Squad Guardian is a Bot that checks numerous Shared Battlemetrics.com Bans Lists every minute for new `Cheater` or `Hacker` Bans. If a matching Ban is found, Squad Guardian will automatically issue a new Ban under it's own Battlemetrics Ban List so that the Guardian Communities can be immediately protected from the same Cheater.
